# Concepts in Python: Loops, Functions, and Returns

By the end of this project, I created a number of examples that helped me develop my understanding of key Python concepts, such as **loops**, **methods**, and **returns**, enabling me to write high-quality code. 

This course took my beginner knowledge of Python to the next level by incorporating loops, functions, and returns into my programming.

As a result, I was able to write more complex code and solve more difficult problems.
